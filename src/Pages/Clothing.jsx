                Samurai placed much value in their armor, which was very
                decorative, as well as functional. The armor was designed to
                intimidate, while providing solid protection against blades and
                arrows. The armor was composed mainly of iron plates tied
                together, creating a flexible and impenetrable armor. On their
                head, they had a helmet, sometimes with animal horns or antlers,
                which gave them the appearance of demons. The helmet was also
                made of high-quality metal, which served the dual purpose of
                intimidation and protection. They also wore a demonic mask,
                which only served to scare, since it didnâ€™t offer any real
                protection. Underneath their armor, they wore a kimono and loose
                pants.
